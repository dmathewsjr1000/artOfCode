## Reading Assignment
Read chapter 17 of ["Eloquent JavaScript"](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) and complete the following coding exercises and writing assignment.

## Coding Exercises
1) Using the Spotify app in the [examples folder](https://github.com/jsogarro/artOfCode/tree/master/examples), add a method that will retrieve the top tracks and display them on the webpage as an ordered list.  

2) Using the Spotify API get an artist's related artists on the platform and display them to the webpage in the form of an unordered list.

3) Write a function that will create an array of numbers that are found in the Fibonacci sequence that are less than 10,000. The first ten elements in the array will look like the following:

```
[1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
```

4) Write a program that will find the sum of all even Fibonacci numbers less than 4,000,000.

**Hint 1: For questions 1 and 2 you should use the [Spotify API Endpoint Reference](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/) as your guide.**

**Hint 2: You should read the MDN guide as a refresher of how to create an ordered list [MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol) and [ordered list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul).**

**Hint 3: You can read more about what the Fibonacci sequence is [here](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html).**

## Writing Assignment
Using your Medium account write a blog explaining what HTTP and AJAX are. Provide a tutorial of how you can use jQuery's Ajax method to get data from the Spotify API.
