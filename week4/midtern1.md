## Conceptual Questions

1) What is your full name?

2) Explain what JavaScript is.

5) What is an expression?

6) What is a statement?

7) Explain what strings are.

8) What is string concatanation? Provide an example.

9) What do we use console.log for? Provide a simple example of how to use it.

10) What are comments and how may they be useful to us? Provide a simple example of how to write a comment.

11) What is a variable?

12) What is the difference between a global and a local variable?

13) Why do you want to use the "var" keyword and why may it be usefule?

14) Name the types that are in JavaScript.

15) What are logical operators? List the logical operators that are in Javascript.

16) What is the difference between "=", "==" and "==="?

17) What does it mean for something to be "truthy?"

18) What does it mean for something to be "falsey?"

19) Explain what an "if" statement is. How can it be useful?

20) What is a loop? Why may it be useful? Provide a simple example of a "for" loop.

21) What are some ways that you can break out of a loop?

22) What does "undefined" represent?

23) Explain the different between "undefined" and "null."

24) What is an array and how may it be useful?

25) What are elements of an Array?

26) What is an array index?

27) How do we move and add items to the front of an array?

28) How do we move and add items to the end of an array?

29) Explain what a function is and how it may be useful?

30) What is the difference between a function expression and a function declaration?

31) What is a parameter?

32) What is an argument?

33) What do we use "return" for in functions?

34) Explain the concept of higher order functions.

35) Explain the concept of scope. How can we create scope in JavaScript?

36) What is an object?

37) What is an object property?

38) Create an object literal that as a height and width property.

39) Explain what a method is.

40) What is a constructor function? Why are they useful?

41) Explain the concept of the "this" keyword in Javascript.

42) What is a prototype and how may it be useful?

Bonus: According to Andre Benjamin, who is the prototype?


## Programming Questions

1) What does 1 + 1 evaluate to?

2) What does 1 + '1' evaluate to?

3) Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

4) Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

```
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
```

It may be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by writing .length after it.

5) Write a function min that takes two arguments and returns their minimum.

6) Create a Sneaker constructor function that has name, brand, releaseDate, size and color properties. Add a method to the sneaker constructor that will tell you how many days you have until that particular sneaker releases.


## Reading Exercise
Read [Chapter 7](http://eloquentjavascript.net/07_elife.html) of Eloquent JavaScript and code along with the examples. You are not required to complete the "Exercises" section. You should write your code to a file called gameOfLife.js and submit that with this completed markdown.
