# Art of Code - Problem Set 1
Please submit your completed problem set through Github using the instructions we will cover in class this week. The deadline to submit your answers to this problem set is **Monday January 18th at 6:30 PM**.

## Reading Assignment
Read chapters 4, 6, 8 and 9 of ["Eloquent JavaScript"](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) and complete the following coding exercises and writing assignment.

## Coding Exercises

1) Create a function that returns the number of words that are in a string.

2) Create a function that takes a string as its input and returns the number of vowels that appear in the string.

*Note: Please include your answers to both questions in a single markdown file in your Git repository (folder) that you will be using to submit this week's homework. You can read more about markdown here: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) (pay special attention to the syntax highlighting section). Please include this file in the root of the directory you will be using to submit your homework.*

3) Create a Shape constructor function that has a height and width property. Include a method that will calculate the area of the shape, where area is defined as the shape's height multiplied by its width.

**Hint: For questions 1 and 2 you may want to search through the MDN guides to find a method on the String prototype that converts a string into an Array**

**Additional Hint: For question 3 you may need to use the "this" keyword. Don't worry if you don't get it now because we'll be covering this during our lecture on Monday.**


## Writing Assignment
Using your Medium, account write a blog post about functions and methods in JavaScript. You should be able to explain the difference between functions and methods. You should also describe what constructor functions are and give an example of how to create and use one.
