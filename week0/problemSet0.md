# Art of Code - Problem Set 0

Please submit your completed problem set in a javascript file for our review. The deadline to submit your answers to this problem set is **Monday, January 11th at 6:29 PM**.

## Reading Assignment
Read chapters 1 -3 of ["Eloquent JavaScript"](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) and complete the following coding exercises and writing assignment.

## Coding Exercises

1) Using a for loop write a program that will capitalize all items in an array of strings. Your program should log the answer to the console so we can see the output when it runs. Use the following array for your example: ["computer", "iphone", "racecar", "macbook", "ipad", "android"];

2) Using an if statement and a for loop write a program that will loop through an array and print only the even numbers. Your program should log the answer to the console so we can see the output when it runs. Use the following array for your example: [45, 22090909, 5698, 90433, 43431, 3454115, 43002, 109981, 545, 14345435, 1009282, 90909, 13233, 443535, 14782920, 49304, 434];

**Hint: For Question 1 you may need to make sure of the [toUpperCase](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase) method. For Question 2 you may need to make use of the modulo operator.**


## Writing Assignment
Using your [Medium](https://medium.com/) account write a blog post that describes the basic principles of programming. Your post should describe what variables, datatypes and logical operators are and how we can use them in our programs. You should also explain how if statements and for loops work. Include code samples to demonstrate your point. These examples should be written in JavaScript. Please include a link to your blog post.
